We will be using a javascript framework called P5.js which you can use to make games, interactive art, animations, musical instruments, physical models, geolocation tools, maps, generative speech and text, the list goes on and on.

### p5.js

You can read more about p5.js [here](https://p5js.org/) and have a play around with some of the [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)

If you like watching video tutorials there are loads on YouTube. Daniel Schiffman's [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=14) series is our favourite and a good place to start learning about p5.js.

For further reading you can find the entire [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/) for free online which is a great foundation for any creative coder.
