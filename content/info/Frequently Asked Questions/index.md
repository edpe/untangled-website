### What do I need to bring?

You can bring your own laptop if you want to, but we have computers you can work on if you don’t.

### Is there anything I can do to get ready for Untangled?
We’re going to be using a javascript framework called P5.js, if you want to read about it/see some examples/try it out please have a read about P5.js above.

You might want to think of some ideas of things you might want to build before you get here, or just wait to be inspired once you make a start.

### What do I do about food?
Please bring a packed lunch with you.
### How many other people will be there?
There will be 12 participants altogether, plus a load of coaches from various arts and tech backgrounds.
### What will I be doing?
You will be making fun things using computers. Some of this will be writing code, some of it will be talking, designing, planning, breaking stuff, failing, succeeding and hopefully lots of learning. See [some of the examples on the p5.js website](https://p5js.org/examples/) to see the type of things you can do.
