## About

Untangled is a week of experimenting, designing and making using code. This will be a mix of web technology, games, interactive art and using data gathered from the world around us.

The course is facilitated and run by Neontribe in partnership with Access Creative College to encourage young people who are excited by technology and coding to develop their skills.
